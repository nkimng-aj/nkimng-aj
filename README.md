**Hi there**🙋‍♂️

I'm Kim Ngoc (AJ), a FTU2 student from a business background who's now wandering into the tech world 🤖

I'm still figuring it out — one bug (and one tutorial) at a time.

**A bit about me:**
- Coffee-dependent & semi-functional
- Business graduate diving into Tech  
- Learning SQL, Python and exploring AI/ML
- Even if I get stuck, I'll make sense of it. Eventually. 🙏 

**Why tech?**
I started in business, but the more I explored, the more I realised how technology could power everything. So now, I'm here: learning, experimenting, and building things that (hopefully) work.
